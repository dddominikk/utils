# Utils

Started moving some of my often revisited Node utilities to TypeScript, will use this repo to keep track of them for now.

### 7zip
### Chocolatey
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
- run with elevated privileges

### Git
```powershell
choco install git.install
```
- this method requires Chocolatey
- it also requires [pointing Windows to a Git installation using the Path environmental variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/error-git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)

### TypeScript
- [Use autogenerated Typescript type definitions from your api inside a namespace](https://mpth.medium.com/use-autogenerated-typescript-type-definitions-from-any-api-inside-a-namespace-3c5bfad8f28d)
